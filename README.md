Prototype for Sentiment Analysis FYP

Python script which performs sentiment analysis on real time tweets from Twitter API which can be selected by entering
a keyword, hashtag or handle and then stores the tweets with their polarity on a CSV file.

Some sample CSV files have been included after running the script multiple times with different keywords so the output can be seen.
